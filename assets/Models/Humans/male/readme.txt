Male pedestrian
===============

Original resources:
-------------------
https://github.com/bubblecloud/jme3-open-asset-pack/tree/master/src/main/resources/character/human/male


Contents:
---------
This contains the OgreXML and the binary version of a male pedastrian.

- the OgreXML version requires the "male.material" and the "male.scene" file as well as all the .png and .xml files
- the binary version requires the "male.j3o" and the .png files


Usage:
------
In order to use the pedestrian with OpenDS, either the file "male.scene" (OgreXML version) or the "male.j3o" 
(binary version) must be loaded.



Texture variants:
-----------------
In the original version, the pedestrian does not wear shoes. Therefore, the original texture has been replaced. The 
new texture colors the feet black, which makes the feet look like shoes or socks. If you prefer the original texture, 
you can delete "young_lightskinned_male_diffuse.png" and rename "young_lightskinned_male_diffuse_barefoot.png".
