The default physics simulation is based on jBullet; however, can be switched to native Bullet.

 * to use native Bullet add the following .jar files to the build path:
   - jme3-bullet.jar
   - jme3-bullet-native.jar

 * to use jBullet add the following .jar files to the build path (default):
   - jme3-jbullet.jar
   - jbullet.jar

Make sure to remove the .jar files of the physics simulation not in use from the build path!


Be aware: The Force Feedback Controller (class eu.opends.logitechsdk.ForceFeedbackController)
          will currently not work with native Bullet!
